42KL is a free bootcamp where students learn to code through peer learning. It is my official start of my programming journey. :)

throughout this bootcamp, topics which I have learnt includes:
- C programming algorithms
- Makefiles
- machine architecture
  - 2's complement
  - int, long number ranges
  - memory allocation like pointers, mallocs and free
